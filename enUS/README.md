# 📝 Welcome to Crossnote (beta)

## 🔭 Introduction

 **Crossnote** is probably the world's first markdown notes reader & editor progressive web application that works offline ~~perfectly~~ (maybe not yet but soon 😂) and supports syncing with arbitrary git repository right inside your browser.

Crossnote is heavily inspired by [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced), [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com), [Quip](https://quip.com),  [Notion](https://www.notion.so), [Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable), [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), and [Bear](https://bear.app/).

Unlike [Crossnote (*alpha*)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xGG/crossnote/master/README.alpha.md), which is completely cloud based, **Crossnote (beta)** aims to be offline first. That is, your data is stored entirely in your browser. We won't collect your notes and credentials to our server. **You own your data**. 

The front end of crossnote project is complete open sourced on GitHub [0xGG/crossnote](https://github.com/0xGG/crossnote). It is released under **AGPL3**. Any contributions or suggestions would be very helpful for the growth of the project.  

You can easily synchronize your notebooks with arbitrary git repositories thanks to the awesome [isomorphis-git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git) project that makes running git possible right inside this web application.  

This application is still under development, and its production website is currently running on a Vultr VPS with only 8GB ram located in Los Angeles.

## 💾 Installation

On desktop computers and android devices, I would suggest you to try [crossnote](https://crossnote.app) on **Chrome**. You can also create `Shortcut` to add it to your home screen (`Menu (top right corner) -> More tools -> Create shortcut...`).

On iOS devices (iPhone and iPad), I would suggest you to try [crossnote](https://crossnote.app) on **Safari** and add the webpage to home screen. ([How to create website shortcuts on iPhone and iPad](https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-create-website-shortcuts-on-iphone-ipad/)).
